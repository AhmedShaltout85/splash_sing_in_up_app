2. Run the package #
After adding your settings to pubspec.yaml, run the following command in the terminal:

dart run flutter_native_splash:create

When the package finishes running, your splash screen is ready.

(Optionally), If you added your config to a separate YAML file instead of pubspec.yaml, just add --path with the command in the terminal:

dart run flutter_native_splash:create --path=flutter_native_splash.yaml
